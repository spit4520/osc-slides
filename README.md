# Kettering Open Source Club Slides

This is simply a git repo that contains all of my (Brian Chrzanowski's) work and
slides for Kettering's Open Source club.

### How To View

The easiest way to view the slides is to simply load up the contents of the git
repo onto a webserver and navigate to the desired set of slides in your web
browser. If you *don't* know how to set up your own, even for demo purposes,
this should help:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### Inspiration

All of the inspiration I got was from
